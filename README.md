# FastAI_Notes
This repo documents my learning outcome in a course organized by fast.ai - Practical Deep Learning for Coders. I am attending the 2nd edition of the course(2018).

The repo consists of the jupyter notebooks lesson demo I replicated and my mini-projects for exercise of techniques learnt from lessons.
