# fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Codes Notes
This repo documents my learning outcome in a course organized by fast.ai - Practical Deep Learning for Coders. The repo consists of the jupyter notebooks lesson demo I replicated and some of my projects as exercises of the course.

## Editions of the course I attended
1. 2018 Edition (fastai v0.7)
2. 2019 Edition (fastai v1.0)

## Fastai version on which my notebooks are based
Some are based on fastai v0.7 and some are based on fastai v1.0

## Issues
[24/01/2019] _resnet32_dress_5class_lesson2_upsize_v3.ipynb_ is currently not working in Google Colab because some packages updates are not compatible with fastai-v0.7
